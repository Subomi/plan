## simple process statement

- supplier:  a user supplies information about a missing person, this may be  but not limited to a law enforcement personnel or relative to the person been looked for. 

- Information: the information provided will be stated in the forms each supplier should fill, to either report a new case, or report a new sighting of any person, or query the database for cases that match any defined filter (un-resolved, resolved, recent etc). 

- Process: information from the form is collected and stored in our database,  and a new event may or may not trigger for the supplier to take another action on the website. (events may include alerting associated users about the updated information, sending sms alerts to law enforcement phone numbers about a new report etc, asking the user the share the information they submitted on social media platforms). 

- Output: users can generate pdf or images from supplied information, share and save. Supplied information will appear will be updated in grids according to the tag they fall into, a unique url is generated for each main report about a missing person which can act as a reference, there is more to this output and we can all brainstorm on it as a team.

- How the information is consumed: there is little to nothing we can control about how the information generated on our platform can be consumed, but we can create social incentives for every user that contributes to the platform in order to have as much as even a little confidence that what they did could make a change,  help someone out, and also make them feel good for contributing at the same time.
